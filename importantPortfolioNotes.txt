need to 

create a new portfolio repo
create an agile todo list in github repo

modify bigProject service to provide aria-labels and titles for existing elements and create additional aria-labels / titles
for other elements, esp button linking to external website of project

links shouldn't be buttons, links should be links

update css across project - compartmentalise the css by component, big-project, navbar, about-me, etc.

ensure that all of the class names and IDs (css) are represented in the elements - could include root index.html file etc.

update the github / linkedin etc. icons all to come from the bootstrap system instead of the other one, although note that the 
star comes from the other service, so you might need both
install and configure the service that enables the FB, insta, github etc icons
bootstrap can do stars: https://icons.getbootstrap.com/icons/star/
