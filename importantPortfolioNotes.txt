need to 

create a new portfolio repo
create an agile todo list in github repo

modify bigProject service to provide aria-labels and titles for existing elements and create additional aria-labels / titles
for other elements, esp button linking to external website of project

links shouldn't be buttons, links should be links

update css across project - you need to figure out how to get even-numbered bigProjects to render on the other side of the screen. 
In the static site much of the work is completed by including or omitting specific class names. There is a way to conditionally
render different classes, possibly using ngClass (needs importing? configuring in the exports?)

ensure that all of the class names and IDs (css) are represented in the elements - could include root index.html file etc.

install and configure the service that enables the FB, insta, github etc icons

create objects for other big projects
