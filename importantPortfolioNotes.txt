need to 

style:
bs-accordion-background via class "accordion", on element: app-bonus-material
and bs-accordion-border-color same issue


delete the experimental components, accordion, toggle etc and delete any references to them

try getting the bonusMaterial items outside of the accordion highest parent div

check the docs to configure for only one open at once

think of a way to sync the order across desktops tablets and mobiles

finalise styling configuration

import the different unique components as per below

to render different components in each of the bonus material sections, I think you need to make use of
Using NgComponentOutlet
https://angular.dev/guide/components/programmatic-rendering
it works! like so: <ng-container *ngComponentOutlet="getBioComponent(bigProject.id)" /> 
so you store a string which will be the argument passed to the function and then in the class definition, you create
the function (switch?) that loads the corresponding function =)

Need to import all the animations and configure them. The BonusMaterials each need to use their id values to create 
unique but matching ids across the different collapsible codes

Need individual functions for the contents of each bonus material, which can be activated in ng-containers (as above)



create a new portfolio repo
create an agile todo list in github repo

modify bigProject service to provide aria-labels and titles for existing elements and create additional aria-labels / titles
for other elements, esp button linking to external website of project

links shouldn't be buttons, links should be links

various animation things need fixing, specifically the light box and mobile / tablet menu toggler, also, disappearing upper
nav bar, which may or may not link with the fact that when you navigate to a section, its title scrolls up behind the
navbar

update css across project - compartmentalise the css by component, big-project, navbar, about-me, etc.

ensure that all of the class names and IDs (css) are represented in the elements - could include root index.html file etc.

update the github / linkedin etc. icons all to come from the bootstrap system instead of the other one, although note that the 
star comes from the other service, so you might need both
install and configure the service that enables the FB, insta, github etc icons
bootstrap can do stars: https://icons.getbootstrap.com/icons/star/
